Lets recap, I have looked into

* Hosting Nancy in a Windows Service and Console Application using Topshelf
* Adding the time taken for a request into the Trace Log
* How to Embed views into the DLL and get them to render

so this is all exciting stuff.

In this post I will look into a really important part of any web application, how to pass the model to the view. (which was easier than I thought it was going to be, bonus)
