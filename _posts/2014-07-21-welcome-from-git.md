##A new blog engine.

My blog at the moment has not been updated for a while. Mostly I have been publishing gists, not writing posts. My current blog engine requires some work and I have been meaning to change the back end to work with Markdown.

##Solution:
Use Jekyll with Github, its already done!

Well most of it. 

For an editor there is a choice.

*Online editors* such as Prose.io, I like the idea, means I can edit content anywhere and all I require is a browser, however a little buggy.

*Desktop*, using source tree (a tool I already use for developing), along with a Markdown editor such as MarkPad.

At the moment I do not mind either way.


##TODO:


+ Port existing posts across
+ Add/Edit content pages
+ Associate my domain with this blog
